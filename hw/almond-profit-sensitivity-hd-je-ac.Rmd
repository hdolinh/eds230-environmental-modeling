# Assignment 3

1. Develop a profit model for your almond yield (you can make this up - think about what the parameters would be)

```{r}
# test model
# idk if any of the results are reasonable...
profit_almond = almond_profit(almond_yield_anomaly = almond_yield_data$almond_yield_pct,
                              year = almond_yield_data$year,
                              price = 10,
                              discount = 0.12)
```

2. Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters

```{r}

```

3. Create a single graph of the results - you can decide what is the most meaningful graph
4. Output the graph as a stand alone image (pdf, tiff, jpeg)

```{r}

```
